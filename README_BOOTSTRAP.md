# Laravel Inertia Bootstrap Template

This file set is copied by `scripts/bootstrap_laravel_inertia.ps1` after a fresh Laravel install.

Included:
- Web route skeleton for Inertia pages.
- API route skeleton for billing phase-1.
- Tenant middleware placeholder.
- Basic web/API controllers.
- Vue page stubs and shared admin layout.

These files are starter stubs and still need real model/service implementations.
